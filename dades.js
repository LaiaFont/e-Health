        "text": "This is a common misconception due to the nickname for the emergency hormonal contraception pill being the ‘morning after pill’. The emergency contraception pill can be given up to 5 days after unprotected sex, although the sooner it’s taken the better. During a study conducted by The Canadian Department of Family Medicine, University of Montreal, and the Canadian Local Center for Community Services, deeper research show that the pregnancy rate was 0.8% for cases who took the emergency contraception pill in the first 72 hours and 1.8% for the ones who took it after the 72 hours, up to 120 hours.",

The evidence suggests that HIV transmission can take place through oro-genital sex from penis to mouth and vagina to mouth. The chance that you will get STIs(Sexually Transmitted Infections) from receiving is very low compared to unprotected vaginal or anal sex. But it's not easy to know what the actual risk is. This is because most people who have oral sex also have vaginal or anal sex.",

Some women have long periods that overlap with the onset of ovulation, which means they are fertile during this period. Suppose a woman has a short cycle (21 days) and menstruation lasts a week. If she has sex near the end of her period, she may become pregnant because the sperm can live for up to 72 hours in the body. Sperm can live for 3–5 days inside a female’s body, which means that a person can get pregnant even if they have sexual intercourse 5 days before they ovulate.",

The original 1988 study reported a difference in rating of 0.82 units on a 10-point scale, the combined data of the later study found a rating difference of 0.03 units.

Parents might for example stick their tongue out several times, if the baby sticks out their tongue once, they will mentally stick to the one time they returned the expression and ignore all the times they didn’t. This is called the selection bias. In a study in 2016 infants were shown 11 gestures. They were shown facial gestures, non-social objects (spoon and box opening), and vocal gestures. The gestures shown by the infant were independent of what the adult model showed them, which means that the babies did not replicate any expressions.

A newer study from 2014 took Americans and members of the Namibian Himba tribe and compared them to each other. The test subjects were given different expressions without a set list of emotions to ascribe to it and the results were wildly different. Americans used emotional words and mental state words (anger, disgust, surprise, concern, etc.) while the Himba used physical action words (laughing, looking at something, etc.). The piles in which similar expressions were sorted into also varied in number. There was only one consistency across both groups: whether the expression was positive or negative and the level of arousal (extremity of the emotion).",

        "date":"15/05/2021",
        "text": "The belief that cracking knuckles leads to arthritis is an old wives tale which comes from early speculation used before there was a better understanding of what precisely happens when one cracks their knuckles. The ‘crack’ is the popping of bubbles in the fluid that lubricates the hands, which is known as synovial fluid. Thus, when the joint is manipulated in certain ways bubble can burst, resulting in an audible cracking sound. Dr. Robert L. Swezey and Stuart E. Swezey supervised a study of 28 nursing home residents in 1975, who could recall whether or not they had cracked their knuckles earlier in life. X-rays have been performed on the participants’ hands and it was concluded that there was no link between arthritis and habitual knuckle cracking. There was also another study published in 1990 issue of the Annals of Rheumatic Disease, which looked at a group of 300 habitual knuckle crackers. It was found that the participants who did that regularly were no more likely than those who did not to have arthritis. While this practice does not cause arthritis, it has some other negative consequences as it has been found that it can lead to swelling in the hands and reduced grip strength.",

A more serious type starts in the back of the nose and usually involves both nostrils. As a result, large amount of bloods can run down in the back of the throat. In order to stop the nosebleed, you have to sit up straight and tip your head slightly forward. It is crucial to not tilt your head back as this may cause the blood to run down the back of your throat and you may swallow it. Then, the swallowed blood can irritate the stomach and cause vomiting.
